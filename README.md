# Portfolio Website

To establish a professional digital presence and showcase my academic and technical work, I developed a personal portfolio website using a customizable HTML5/CSS3 template as the foundation. The site was adapted and personalized to reflect my background, highlight my skills in data analytics and information systems, and centralize access to my featured projects and online profiles.

Leveraging the template allowed me to focus on front-end development fundamentals, such as responsive design, content structuring, and interactive navigation, while also customizing the layout, color scheme, image assets, and component styling to align with my personal branding.

**The website includes:**
- A dynamic landing page introducing myself and the purpose of the site,
- A comprehensive About Me section summarizing my education, interests, and analytical mindset,
- A visually organized Projects section, with direct links to individual GitHub repositories and Tableau dashboards, showcasing work in SQL, Python, data visualization, and CRM systems,
- A Contact page containing my LinkedIn, GitHub, and email for professional outreach and networking opportunities.

**What I Learned:**

Through this project, I gained both technical and professional skills, including:
- Website Structuring and Front-End Development – By working within a templated HTML/CSS framework, I improved my ability to read, edit, and structure semantic HTML while learning how to efficiently style and organize content using CSS.
- Responsiveness and Usability – I explored the importance of building mobile-responsive layouts and optimizing the user experience for different screen sizes.
- Customization and Branding – I learned how to adapt an existing codebase and visual design to represent my professional identity and create a cohesive brand narrative.
- Content Curation – Writing compelling, relevant descriptions for my projects challenged me to communicate technical skills in a clear and accessible way, an essential soft skill for interviews and presentations.
- Version Control and Deployment Readiness – By hosting my project on GitHub, I reinforced best practices in version tracking and code organization.

**Outcomes:**
- Created a professional, scalable website that I now use in job applications, networking conversations, and academic outreach.
- Improved confidence in front-end web technologies and how to use templates effectively for real-world presentations.
- Developed a deeper understanding of how to present technical skills and projects to a non-technical audience, bridging the gap between data work and business communication.
- Enhanced my online visibility by integrating LinkedIn, GitHub, and project demos into one accessible hub.

This project strengthened my ability to work with structured HTML codebases, integrate design elements efficiently, and communicate technical experience through a polished user interface. It also demonstrates my initiative in developing a real-world digital artifact that supports career readiness and builds visibility within the data analytics community.
By customizing a modern web template, I gained valuable experience in front-end adaptation and content curation—skills that complement my technical abilities in data analysis and business intelligence.
